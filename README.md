# Nuxt 3 Stock Screener

This is a web app that visualizes financial statements of publicly traded companies.
It uses Nuxt 3 because VueCharts and Nuxt 2 are not compatible.

## Dependencies

- Tailwind
- VueCharts

### Additional Notes

This project uses the nuxt3 tailwind starter code by Dan Vega. It can be found here: https://github.com/danvega/nuxt3-tailwind3-starter
